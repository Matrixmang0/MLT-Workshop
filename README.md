# MLT Workshop: Implementing Machine Learning Techniques

Welcome to the "Implementing Machine Learning Techniques" workshop as part of the MLT course. This repository contains code and resources for the workshop.

## Workshop Description

The MLT workshop titled "Implementing Machine Learning Techniques" is the coding part of the MLT course and is open to all those who have successfully completed the MLT course.

## Workshop Content

The workshop materials are organized into four main folders: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4. Each day's content is described below:

### Day 1

Day 1 focuses on fundamental concepts and hands-on exercises. It includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

- [2_Plotting_Simple_Curves.ipynb](<https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/(2)_Plotting_Simple_Curves.ipynb>): Creating and plotting simple mathematical curves using Python.
- [3_Matrices.ipynb](<https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/(3)_Matrices.ipynb>): Understanding matrices, matrix operations, and matrix algebra.
- [4_Sampling_and_Visualisation_Bar,\_Histogram,\_Scatter.ipynb](<https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/(4)_Sampling_and_Visualisation_Bar,_Histogram,_Scatter.ipynb>): Sampling data and visualizing it using bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- [5_NumPy_Arrays.ipynb](<https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/(5)_NumPy_Arrays.ipynb>): Exploring NumPy arrays, fundamental data structures for numerical computation.
- [6_Contour_Plots,\_3D_Plots,\_Optimization.ipynb](<https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/(6)_Contour_Plots,_3D_Plots,_Optimization.ipynb>): Introduction to contour plots, 3D plots, and optimization techniques in machine learning.
- [NumPy_Workshop.pdf](https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%201/NumPy%20Workshop.pdf): A supplementary PDF document for the NumPy workshop.

### Day 2

Day 2 covers regression techniques, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and regression evaluation metrics. Files include:

- [Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%202/Regression.ipynb): Introduction to regression techniques.

### Day 3

Day 3 focuses on K-Means clustering, a refresher on NumPy arrays, and the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification. Files include:

- [K_Means.ipynb](https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%203/K_Means.ipynb): Introduction to K-Means clustering.
- [Numpy_Arrays_Refresher.ipynb](https://github.com/Matrixmang0/MLT-Workshop/blob/main/Day%203/Numpy_Arrays_Refresher.ipynb): A refresher on NumPy arrays.
